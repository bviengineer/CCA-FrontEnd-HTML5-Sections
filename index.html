                                <p>There are number of coding related resources geared toward children of all ages, which also seem to also be growing in popularity and variety. Given the number of available options, parents should review choices and select which option best suit their child(ren) learning style, family, schedule and budget.</p>
                                <p>For the sake of simplicity, they have been classified in to four categories:</p>

                                <h3>Online Coding Resoruces for Kids</h3>
                                    <p>There are a number of online resources available to kids who have an interest in computer science in the form of creating games, building websites, creating apps and the like. The services range in cost from free to subscription based to one-time payment or a combination of free and fee-based.  From the comfort of their home and during spare or downtime and with as little as 30 minutes to one hour, kids can learn fundamental computer science skills via age-approprite and interactive content found on sources like:

                                        <h3>Extra Cirricular</h3>                                
                                            <p>There exist a subset of organizations that specialize in teaching kids how to code after-school througout the school year, in their sparetime, during the long summer months or shorter school breaks.  Extra cirricular related classes typically are one week in length but can run up to an entire summer in the case of summer sesions or, on an on-going basis. These options are typically fee-based and range in cost.</p>

                                        <p>Community-centered organizations play a vital role in the communities they serve by providing exposure to computer science via technical workshops and fieldtrips. This type of resource is works well for families who will like to engage in computer science on  regular basis but is unable to commit to a particular resource or who may not have access to a computer or the internet.
